// FILE: src/utils/pdfStorage.js
// PURPOSE: Persists generated Daily Invoice PDFs to disk so re-opening the
// Daily Invoices page (or clicking "Generate" again) reuses the same file
// instead of re-minting a new invoice number every time (see STEP 17 —
// idempotency — in the daily-invoice feature notes).
//
// STEP 15 note: this is local-filesystem storage, correct for local dev
// and for a single-instance server with a persistent disk. If this app is
// deployed somewhere with an ephemeral filesystem (e.g. a platform that
// wipes disk on every deploy/restart), swap savePdf/readPdf here for
// object storage (S3, Cloudinary, etc.) — every caller in
// dailyInvoiceService.js only depends on this file's two exports, so the
// swap is contained to this one file.

// path ultimately comes from a DB record, not directly from user input,
// but we never trust it blindly (STEP 16 security requirement).
